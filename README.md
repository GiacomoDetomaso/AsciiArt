# AsciiArt
 Example of a paint-like program in c, using a matrix as a canvas. 
 
 It is possible to design:
  - dots 
  - lines (both vertical and horizontal), knowing the origin coordinates
  - squares and rectangles, knowing the top left corner coordinates
  - circles knowing ray and centre's coordinates
 
 This is a good excercie to practice with matrices in C
